## Funds' allocation Breakdown

### Treemap

Probably we can represent this in a `treemap` like the following one, in which each area represents an administrative level (County, District, and Parish).

<!-- We could embed a json like this:
{{< chart data="treemap" >}} -->

<figure class="iframe-wrapper">
  <embed src="/media/html_widgets/EATF-breakdown-treemap.html" style="height:900px;width:100%">
</figure>

### Sankey

Or in a sankey diagram like this one:

<figure class="iframe-wrapper">
  <embed src="/media/sankey.html" style="height:500px;width:100%">
</figure>


<div class="featured-image-wrapper"> 
<div style="position: relative">
<embed class="featured-image" src="/media/sankeyPlotlyBasic1.html" style="height:500px;width:100%">
</div>
</div>
