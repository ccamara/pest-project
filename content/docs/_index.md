## Background

The Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the way we move around today. As government looks to end lock-down and get the public back to work, there are huge challenges for the transport system. Social distancing measures specifying a two-metre physical distancing rule to reduce the spread of the virus create a ‘capacity challenge’. To address this, local authorities have been tasked by government to rapidly develop policies and projects to support active travel such as, walking, cycling, electric biking (‘e-biking’) and electric scooting (‘e-scooting’).

In May 2020, the UK Department for Transport announced an Emergency Active Travel Fund of £250M to support measures including pop-up ‘emergency’ bike lanes; wider pavements; junction improvements; and, cycle and bus-only streets. Laws on the use of electric scooters (‘e-scooters’) and the potential roll- out of e-scooter public rental schemes were also bought forward for review. An announcement of further investment for local authorities to reconfigure their local transport systems is anticipated in June 2020 with the publication of the government’s Cycling and Walking strategy.

Active travel could play a significant role in any green recovery investment package to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and healthier and more equitable ecosystems. This will, however, depend on government policy and supporting legislation; level of investment; the ambition of local authorities to pursue active travel schemes; local political will, and of course, public response in the context of broader social and economic challenges.

## Goals

Against this backdrop, the aim of the PEST project is to increase understanding of place-based policy and activity in relation to active travel in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic by investigating the response of English local planning and highway authorities to the UK government’s Emergency Active Travel Fund (EATF) and Cycling and Walking strategy.
 
The project will reveal the package of post Covid-19 measures adopted by all English local highway authorities to support active travel. It will identify successful (and less successful) processes of delivery in terms of engagement strategy, the actors involved, and any new or existing frameworks that were instrumental in project realisation.

## Indicator Matrix

To achieve this we will seek to co-produce a matrix of indicators with stakeholder advisors that can be used to record the nature of measures and the extent to which these support equitable and sustainable transport (i.e. serve low income neighbourhoods; younger and older people; and BAME groups). The matrix will be completed using a mixture of desk-based research of online and published material; online surveys of chief highway officers; and follow-up tele/video conference interviews with a selected sample. A series of in-depth case studies will be conducted for a range of ‘flagship’ authority schemes through site visits and interviews with key actors – criteria for selection will be developed but could include, for example, government backed ‘Future Transport Zones’. A stakeholder advisory group including Sustrans, Cycling UK and Living Streets, will be invited to convene online from inception, and then on a quarterly basis, to co-produce indicators, scrutinise research and monitor progress.

The overall contribution will be the production and dissemination of recommendations for local authorities and stakeholder groups and the facilitation of knowledge exchange. To achieve this, we will set up a website and social media based on experience of involvement in the award winning cycle BOOM project ( ). This will include a monthly blog kept updated throughout the duration of the project and the publication of a digital report freely available for download from the website. At project end, we will host a webinar to present findings from the study to NGOs, local authorities and UK Department for Transport.
