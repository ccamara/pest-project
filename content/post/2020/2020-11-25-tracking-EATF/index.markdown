As part of the Government's measures to face COVID-19 pandemic, [Secretariat of State announced 23rd May 2020 a £250 million package](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/2-billion-package-to-create-new-era-for-cycling-and-walking) to reallocate road space to encourage active travel while keeping 2-meter social distancing. The package, known as **Emergency Active Travel Funds (EATF)**, is to foster already ongoing measures towards decarbonisation such as installing cycle facilities with a minimum level of physical separation from volume traffic, encouraging walking and cycling to school, reducing speed limits, introducing pedestrian and cycle zones and modal filters amongst others (Department of Transport, 2020). Local authorities were to apply by submitting their proposals, in either of its two phases (May 2020 and November 2020) and the final EATF allocation can be accessed in [this page at Department of Transport's transparency data.](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emergency-active-travel-fund-local-transport-authority-allocations/emergency-active-travel-fund-total-indicative-allocations) Unfortunately, it only lists succinct information per unitary authority, with no further information about the location and typology of the actually funded schemes.

If knowing what authorities do in relation to Active Travel is of extreme importance to assess and improve existing infrastructure, today, with COVID-19 pandemic, is even more so. It is for that reason that, unsurprisingly, there have been a number of attempts by non-profits and activists to trace schemes and funds, may it be for decision-making, assessment or accountability reasons. In this blog post, we are going to explore some of those attempts (some of them made by [our stakeholders](/about/#people)) to contribute to a better understanding of the EATF, which is part of PEST-project goals, too.

## Widen my Path

Developed by [Cyclestreets](https://www.cyclestreets.org), [Widen my path](https://www.widenmypath.com/) is a crowdsourced database enables anyone to add suggestions on how city councils should modify public space to broaden paths for keeping social distance, as well as voting existing suggestions. Proposals can be of these 3 categories: 

1.  Space for cycling

2.  Wider pavements

3.  Closures to through-traffic

Since the goal is to inform decision-makers about places that are considered to be crucial or feasible, Cyclestreets have made an effort for this tool to be re-used, by providing an API to customize how can it be embedded in other websites, releasing all the data under open licence and CSV and GeoJson formats and providing a link from Cycling UK to submit this information to city councils.

  

## A cycle powered Covid recovery

Cycling UK has a [specific page on their website](https://www.cyclinguk.org/cycle-powered-covid-recovery) aimed to explain Covid-related measures to promote active travel that includes [a map to track Emergency Active Travel Funds](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1x7LrFvjDTA-hi_3pt7oquOfMAnUV5LKG&usp=sharing) for [England](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1x7LrFvjDTA-hi_3pt7oquOfMAnUV5LKG&usp=sharing) and another one to [track planned and ongoing measures in Scotland](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=1NlXO4_g0HjgnEHOKA56e3y5makiisqKs&ll=57.90338742124505%2C-4.039338250000011&z=6), as well as contacting local councils to express support for well-designed and targeted measures to create separated space for people cycling and walking, ask them to act swiftly and with ambition in creating more space for cycling.

The map provides basic information per unitary authority, such as the name of the authority, the total allocated funds, the difference from the expected total and a link to contact local authority. While quite easy to understand, it is unclear where data is gathered and, therefore, to assess its exhaustiveness and accuracy. Also, data is locked in Google Mymaps plattform, with no possibility to download data nor contribute to the map.

They used to have another map named "[Social Distancing - Active Travel interventions in the UK](https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1CbqvW6Q-FQaPzIeXwnzmS4l2pDJjtWry&usp=sharing)", providing locations in the UK and Crown Dependencies where councils have taken action to protect social distancing and linking to source of information (either City council's official pages [like this one](https://www.oxford.gov.uk/news/article/1420/city_council_to_explore_once_in_a_generation_improvements_to_city_centre_beyond_the_coronavirus_pandemic) ot tweets [like this one](https://twitter.com/TweetbeatIOM/status/1243579094207520769)). The map had a contact email address to add missing information, but no other types of collaboration were present.

  

## Space to move

</figure>

[Sustrans](https://sustrans.org.uk/)' [Space to Move](https://www.sustrans.org.uk/space-to-move) tool is a crowdsourced database of Active Travel schemes aimed to provide a comprehensive map as well as gathering opinion about each scheme.

Space to Move is updated on a weekly basis and currently has more than 1,200 points, making it one of the more comprehensive maps we have just found. Furthermore, it is a live map which anyone can contribute to in two different ways. First, sharing their opinion about specific schemes by filling a survey linked to every node. Second, populate the database with missing schemes by filling a [public form](https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/spacetomoveschemes) with the requested information. Last, but not least, data is licenced under ODbL and can be downloaded from [Sustrans' OpenData portal](https://data-sustrans-uk.opendata.arcgis.com/search?tags=space%20to%20move), making it extremely easy to reuse and analyse it by anyone who is interested.
