Lancashire was awarded £2.8m for the second phase of DPFT's Emergency Active Travel Funds, an amount that puts the region in the 15th position in terms of budget allocation[^1]. Lancashire County Council will be using that budget to implement two permanent and high-quality schemes: a Low Traffic Neighbourhood in Sandylands, and a super cycleway connecting Penwortham to Preston. These measures are part of the County Council's strategy to promote walking and cycling for regular journeys, which were complemented with other temporary measures carried out in Lancaster, Preston and West Lancashire.

In addition to the deplyment of the schemes, LCC will also be delivering a [consultation plan](https://www.lancashire.gov.uk/media/921153/active-travel-fund-consultation-plan.docx) and a monitoring and evaluation programme targetted to assess their outcomes and outputs. Both are considered as an "essential part of the process of delivering successful schemes within local communities" and their results will be used to inform the future development of their plan to foster active travel.
