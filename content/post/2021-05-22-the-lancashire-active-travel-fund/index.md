Lancashire was awarded £2.8m for the second phase of DPFT's Emergency Active Travel Funds, an amount that puts the region in the 15th position in terms of budget allocation[^1]. Lancashire County Council will be using that budget to implement 2 permanent and high-quality schemes: a Low Traffic Neighbourhood in Sandylands, and a super cycleway connecting Penwortham to Preston. These measures are part of the County Council's strategy to promote walking and cycling for regular journeys, which were complemented with other temporary measures as
