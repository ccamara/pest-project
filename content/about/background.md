The Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the way we move around today. Active travel could play a significant role in any green recovery investment package to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and healthier and more equitable ecosystems. This will, however, depend on government policy and supporting legislation; level of investment; the ambition of local authorities to pursue active travel schemes; local political will, and of course, public response in the context of broader social and economic challenges.

In May 2020, the UK Department for Transport [announced](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/transport-secretary-announces-new-measures-to-keep-passengers-safe-now-and-level-up-for-the-future) an [Emergency Active Travel Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emergency-active-travel-fund-local-transport-authority-allocations) to support local authorities in implementing temporary measures including pop-up ‘emergency’ bike lanes; wider pavements; junction improvements; and, cycle and bus-only streets. These phase one awards were announced in July 2020. Investment to support the creation of longer-term projects as part of a phase two Active Travel Fund was announced in November 2020.
