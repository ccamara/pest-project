To achieve this we will seek to co-produce a matrix of indicators with stakeholder advisors that can be used to record the nature of measures and the extent to which these support equitable and sustainable transport (i.e. serve low income neighbourhoods; younger and older people; and BAME groups). The matrix will be completed using a mixture of desk-based research of online and published material; online surveys of chief highway officers; and follow-up tele/video conference interviews with a selected sample. A series of in-depth case studies will be conducted for a range of ‘flagship’ authority schemes through site visits and interviews with key actors – criteria for selection will be developed but could include, for example, government backed ‘Future Transport Zones’. A stakeholder advisory group including Sustrans, Cycling UK and Living Streets, will be invited to convene online from inception, and then on a quarterly basis, to co-produce indicators, scrutinise research and monitor progress.
