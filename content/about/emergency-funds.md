In May 2020, the UK Department for Transport [announced]() an [Emergency Active Travel Fund](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/emergency-active-travel-fund-local-transport-authority-allocations) of £250M to support measures including pop-up ‘emergency’ bike lanes; wider pavements; junction improvements; and, cycle and bus-only streets. Laws on the use of electric scooters (‘e-scooters’) and the potential roll- out of e-scooter public rental schemes were also bought forward for review. An announcement of further investment for local authorities to reconfigure their local transport systems is anticipated in June 2020 with the publication of the government’s Cycling and Walking strategy.

Active travel could play a significant role in any green recovery investment package to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and healthier and more equitable ecosystems. This will, however, depend on government policy and supporting legislation; level of investment; the ambition of local authorities to pursue active travel schemes; local political will, and of course, public response in the context of broader social and economic challenges.
