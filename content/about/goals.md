Against this backdrop, **the aim of the PEST project is to increase understanding of place-based policy and activity in relation to active travel in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic** by investigating the response of English local planning and highway authorities to the UK governmentâ€™s Emergency Active Travel Fund (EATF) and Cycling and Walking strategy.

The project will reveal the package of post Covid-19 measures adopted by all English local highway authorities to support active travel. It will identify successful (and less successful) processes of delivery in terms of engagement strategy, the actors involved, and any new or existing frameworks that were instrumental in project realisation.
