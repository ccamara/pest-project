[Oxford Brookes University](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/) has over 150 years of history. We started out as a small School of Art in borrowed teaching rooms and have grown into one of the UK's top modern universities with a local, national and international reputation for teaching and research excellence (see some of our [recent results and achievements here](https://www.brookes.ac.uk/about-brookes/at-a-glance/results-and-achievements/)).
