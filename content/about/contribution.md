The overall contribution will be the production and dissemination of recommendations for local authorities and stakeholder groups and the facilitation of knowledge exchange. To achieve this, we will set up a website and social media based on experience of involvement in the award winning [cycle BOOM project](https://www.cycleboom.org/). This will include a monthly blog kept updated throughout the duration of the project and the publication of a digital report freely available for download from the website. At project end, we will host a webinar to present findings from the study to NGOs, local authorities and UK Department for Transport.
