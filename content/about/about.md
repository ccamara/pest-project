### Background 

The Covid-19 pandemic has created unprecedented challenges for the way we move around today. Active travel could play a significant role in any green recovery investment package to accelerate the transition to climate neutrality and healthier and more equitable ecosystems. This will, however, depend on government policy and supporting legislation; level of investment; the ambition of local authorities to pursue active travel schemes; local political will, and of course, public response in the context of broader social and economic challenges.

<!-- 
### Goals:


* Increase understanding of place-based policy and activity in relation to active travel in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic
  * Assess how they support equitable and sustainable transport for most vulnerable colectives/areas
  * Assess Active Travelâ€™s role in the transition to climate neutrality and healthier and more equitable ecosystems -->
