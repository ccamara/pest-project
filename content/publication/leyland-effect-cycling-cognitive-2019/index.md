abstract: It has been demonstrated that, on their own, both exercise and stimulation
  from the environment can improve cognitive function and well-being in older adults.
  The combined effect of exercising in the outdoor environment on psychological function
  is less well studied. The aim of the current study was to investigate the effect
  of an outdoor cycling intervention on cognitive function and mental health and well-being
  in older adults. A total of 100 older adults took part in the study (aged 50â€“ 83),
  26 of which were non-cycling controls, 36 were conventional pedal cyclists and 38
  were participants using an e-bike (a bike fitted with an electric motor to provide
  assistance with pedaling), as part of a larger project (www.cycleboom.org). Participants
  took part in the study for an eight-week period, with cycling participants required
  to cycle at least three times a week for thirty minutes in duration for each cycle
  ride. Cognitive function and well-being were measured before and after the intervention
  period. For executive function, namely inhibition (the Stroop task) and updating
  (Letter Updating Task), both cycling groups improved in accuracy after the intervention
  compared to non-cycling control participants. E-bike participants also improved
  in processing speed (reaction times in go trials of the Stop-It task) after the
  intervention compared to non-cycling control participants. Finally, e-bike participants
  improved in their mental health score after the intervention compared to non-cycling
  controls as measured by the SF-36. This suggests that there may be an impact of
  exercising in the environment on executive function and mental health. Importantly,
  we showed a similar (sometimes larger) effect for the e-bike group compared to the
  pedal cyclists. This suggests that it is not just the physical activity component
  of cycling that is having an influence. Both pedal cycles and e-bikes can enable
  increased physical activity and engagement with the outdoor environment with e-bikes
  potentially providing greater benefits.
