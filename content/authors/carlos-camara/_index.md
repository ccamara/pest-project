I pursue a positive impact on people’s lives through the shaping of physical and digital spaces. In order to do so, I study the commodifications between cities, technology and society in the context of the Urban Studies. So far, I have applied a spatial reading with a social perspective to the topic of spatial inequities, and, more specifically, on urban mobilities for disabled people and urban commons to find ways in which cities can be more resilient and egalitarian.
