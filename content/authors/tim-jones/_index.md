My research interests focus around how urban environments can be (re)configured to support and promote sustainable and healthy urban mobility, particularly walking and cycling. By 'healthy sustainable urban mobility' I mean ways of moving around built environments that minimise environmental impact, improve health and wellbeing and provide equal access to opportunities. Ultimately these are spaces that are more democratic and liveable. I am also interested in the concept of mobility more generally and in particular how certain types of mobility (particularly walking and cycling and micromobilities) are given meaning within certain geographical, social and cultural contexts. I try to develop an understanding this phenomenon through novel mixed method approaches to try to reveal the physical, social and cultural factors that influence everyday travel decisions and how this affects journey practice and experience.
